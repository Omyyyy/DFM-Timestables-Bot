# DFM-Timestables-Bot

Ever wanted to cheat on the 'Timestables' section of DrFrostMaths and get like 70 correct answers? Well you're in luck!

# Prerequesites

Nothing, just be logged into DFM before running. The bot will open the page for you, don't worry. Just run 'main.exe', enter your target score when prompted, and sit back.

If you wanna run the 'main.py' file, you'll need to have two Python packages; 'pyautogui' and 'pyperclip'. Install these with the command prompt commands 'pip install pyautogui' and 'pip install pyperclip'. You don't need to bother with this if you don't want to though, just run 'main.exe'.

MAKE SURE YOUR BROWSER IS SCALED AT 100%, OR IT WON'T WORK

# Running

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter your target score. The bot will do this many questions. Note: The highest number DFM physically allows it to go is 70 correct answers; the bot will automatically stop at 70.
